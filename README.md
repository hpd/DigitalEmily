Digital Emily
= 

This is a set of assets based on the [Digital Emily project](http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Research/DigitalEmily2/), using data captured in the [Light Stage](http://gl.ict.usc.edu/LightStages/). These were created with an eye towards facilitating further experimentation with the existing dataset, extending material definitions for [Vray](https://www.vray.com/) and the skin shader in [OSL](https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage) provided on the main site. 

This is a personal project from Haarm-Pieter Duiker of Duiker Research.

Repository Contents
-

The project contains lights, camera and geometry elements that are renderer independent. 

The project also contains a [mental ray](http://www.nvidia-arc.com/mentalray.html) specific 'Assembled' scene along with a file with only the materials for mental ray. The mental ray materials make use of the [mila layered materials library](http://blog.mentalray.com/2014/04/18/layering-in-maya2015/).

The project was created in [Maya 2016 SP4](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/downloads/caas/downloads/content/autodesk-maya-2016-service-pack-4.html). 

The frames were rendered with a camera that animates through the static camera positions. Frame 1 corresponds to Light Stage Camera 0. Frame 2 to Light Stage Camera 1 and so on.
